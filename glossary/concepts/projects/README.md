# Projects

## What are projects in Vectice?

Projects enable data science leaders **to oversee team workflows and track data science projects**.


Within each workspace, you can create multiple projects, each with its own phases and assets.


## Project Features

<table><thead><tr><th width="140">Features</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Phases</td><td>Phases help organize project objectives, maintain consistency, enforce best practices, and document knowledge.</td></tr><tr><td>Project overview</td><td>Overview of the project, including the owner, details, status, and progress of each phase.</td></tr><tr><td>Project templates</td><td>Templates offer an easy start for projects. The default template gives you a pre-filled project using CRISP-DM methodology.</td></tr><tr><td>Asset logging</td><td>Assets like code, datasets, and models can be added to your project using the Vectice API, where their source, version, and details are documented in the Vectice app.</td></tr><tr><td>Duplicate projects</td><td>Duplicating a project makes a new one with all the phases, documentation, and requirements, but without copying iterations, models, and datasets.</td></tr><tr><td>Move projects</td><td>Transferring a project to a different workspace moves all its components like phases, iterations, models, and datasets. Projects can only be moved to workspaces where you are a member.</td></tr><tr><td><span data-gb-custom-inline data-tag="emoji" data-code="26a0">⚠️</span> Transfer ownership</td><td>Project owners and Workspace Admins can transfer project ownership to another member.<br><br>Only Workspace Managers can <strong>undo</strong> this action.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Things you should know

* You can customize the default project template to fit your organization's needs. For example, you can create project templates for Analytics, Operations, Machine Learning, and more.
* The project statuses will automatically update as your project phases progress.
* You can find your **Project ID** and **Workspace ID** under the Project details on your project's Overview page.

## Projects best practices

* When assigning a **Project Owner**, this person should be the point of contact for project-related questions or concerns.
