# Define phase requirements

## What are requirements?

Requirements are specific objectives that need to be met to complete a project phase. They act as clear, actionable goals for your team.

### Why define requirements?

* **Clarity:** Provides team members with a clear understanding of expectations.
* **Focus:** Helps teams concentrate on essential goals, boosting efficiency.
* **Progress Tracking:** Allows for monitoring of achievements against set objectives.

**Best Practice:**&#x20;

* Be concise and clear in your descriptions.
* Make these requirements specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).
* Clearly communicate these requirements to your team. Ensure everyone understands what is expected and why it's important.
