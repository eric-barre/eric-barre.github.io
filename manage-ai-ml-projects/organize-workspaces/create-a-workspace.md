# Create a workspace


Admins can allow all users in an organization to create workspaces. Otherwise, only Admins can do so.


There are two ways to create workspaces. You can either:

1. Click **Create** in the header and select **Create workspace**.
2. Go to the **Workspaces** page and click the **Create Workspace** button.

From there, select the type of workspace you prefer. You would have the following options:

* **Private workspace:** Only specific people have access, can only be viewed or joined by invitation.
* **Organization shared workspace:** Anyone in Vectice has access.

:tada: **You're all set!**&#x20;
