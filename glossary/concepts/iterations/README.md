# Iterations

An iteration is a recurring work cycle within a phase, primarily used to log assets (models, datasets, graphs, and notes) to document the work and maintain transparency throughout an AI project.

### Why use iterations?

* Empower Data Scientists to achieve goals, evaluate results, and refine methods with feedback.&#x20;
* Facilitate informed decision-making, knowledge capture, and enhanced collaboration.&#x20;
* Ensure progress preservation, build trust in AI projects, and enable time-saving through efficient [iterative developments](iterative-development.md).
