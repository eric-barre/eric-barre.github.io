1.  **Standard project with CRISP-DM template**

    A structured project template based on the CRISP-DM methodology, offering a proven framework with predefined phases for data-driven projects.
2.  **Empty project**&#x20;

    Start with a blank canvas, allowing total customization and flexibility to plan and structure your project.
3.  **Quickstart project**

    Create a Quickstart project to discover Vectice in a few easy steps.
4.  **Sample tutorial project**

    Create a tutorial project to learn about Vectice's features, functionalities, and workflows through practical experience.

Pick the option that best suits your project needs.&#x20;
