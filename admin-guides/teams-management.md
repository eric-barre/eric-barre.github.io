# Teams management

**Teams** in Vectice simplify user management by allowing administrators to group users with similar responsibilities, assign workspace roles efficiently, and streamline collaboration. Designed with enterprise needs, Teams make managing permissions and responsibilities across workspaces intuitive and scalable.


Vectice seamlessly integrates with your enterprise SSO/LDAP system for efficient team management.


With Teams, you can:

* **Create and manage teams** with unique names and optional descriptions.
* **Enable or disable teams** as needed to fit your organizational needs.
* **View team details** in a user-friendly table, including filters for status, creation date, and creator.
* **Access team-specific insights** such as the number of members, workspaces assigned, creator, and last updated details.
* **Assign teams to workspaces** with predefined roles: **Reviewer**, **Editor**, or **Manager**.
* **Inherit the highest level of rights** when users are assigned roles through multiple teams or individually.
* **Automatically generate activity logs** for key team events like creation, role changes, and workspace assignments.
* **Notify users and workspace managers** when they are added/removed from a team or when a team is assigned/removed from a workspace.
