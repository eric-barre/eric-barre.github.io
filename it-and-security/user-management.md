# User management

Effectively manage users within Vectice by updating user roles, editing existing user information, and deactivating or deleting user accounts as needed. Refer to our comprehensive [User management](../admin-guides/user-management/) guide for Admins for more information.

## **User roles**

User roles define a user's access level and permissions within Vectice. By assigning the appropriate role, you can grant users the ability to perform specific actions within the platform. This ensures data security and system integrity by granting access only to each user's required functionalities.&#x20;

To learn more about the different user roles available and how to assign them to users, consult our [User roles and permissions](../admin-guides/user-management/user-roles-and-permissions.md) guide.

## **Workspace rights**

Workspace rights control what actions users can perform within specific workspaces in Vectice. For a comprehensive explanation of workspace rights and how to assign them to users, explore our [Workspace management ](../admin-guides/workspace-management.md)guide.
