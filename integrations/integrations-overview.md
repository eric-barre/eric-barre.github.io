### Vectice x IBM watsonx

Our integration with IBM Watsonx delivers a seamless, end-to-end solution that streamlines compliance throughout the model lifecycle.

Vectice complements Watsonx by:

* **Automating AI documentation:** Ensuring Model Development Documents (MDDs) and Model Validation Documents (MVDs) are automatically generated and audit-ready.
* ‚Äç**Enriching metadata integration**: Capturing granular model metadata across the AI lifecycle, enhancing watsonx traceability capabilities.
* ‚Äç**Simplifying evidence gathering and ensuring audit readiness**: Vectice captures and organizes critical evidence, including code, model and dataset lineage, testing outcomes, and version history.
* ‚Äç**Expanding cross-platform governance support:** Allowing metadata from various AI development environments (e.g. IBM Watson Studio, Jupyter Notebooks, Databricks, SageMaker) to integrate seamlessly with Watsonx governance.

## üíª Notebooks, IDEs, CI/CD, & Pipelines

Streamline development using Vectice alongside your notebooks, IDEs, and CI/CD tools for a cohesive coding and deployment experience.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can integrate Vectice within these environments by [installing the Vectice library package](../log-and-manage-assets-with-vectice-api/connect-to-api.md).

### Proxy support

You can use Vectice with an `HTTP` and a `HTTPS` proxy server. This is used to connect your ecosystems to the Vectice instance. To route all Vectice traffic through the proxy server, set the environment variable to the proxy URL.

#### HTTPS Example <a href="#http-example" id="http-example"></a>

```
HTTPS_PROXY = "https://user:password@proxy.host.com:port"
```

Environment variables:

* `HTTP_PROXY` is the proxy to use for HTTP requests.
* `HTTPS_PROXY` is the proxy to use for HTTPS requests. In most cases, this is the same as `HTTPS_PROXY`.
* `PROXY` is your personal proxy.
* `NO_PROXY` is a comma-separated list of DNS suffixes or IP addresses that can be accessed without passing through the proxy.

## üîÑ MLOps Platforms

Simplify model management and deployment with Vectice integrations for popular MLOps platforms, automating workflows and improving consistency.

## :timer: Productivity Platforms

**JIRA Integration \[BETA]**

Vectice integrates with JIRA to display epics and their associated stories, including statuses, directly within your documentation as interactive widgets. Data refreshes automatically when users with proper JIRA credentials reopen the page, ensuring on demand, up-to-date information.

The JIRA integration allows teams to:

* **Unify Documentation**: Automatically include JIRA metadata, keeping stakeholders informed without switching tools.
* **Maintain Context**: Link technical progress with business objectives by embedding relevant JIRA details into documentation.

With this integration, your team can ensure project updates are always aligned with documentation, fostering better collaboration and transparency.

**Confluence Compatibility**

Documentation can be exported seamlessly in Word formats, making it easy to integrate with Confluence. Users can import these files through the Confluence UI, incorporating Vectice documentation into their workflows effortlessly.

**Google Docs Compatibility**

Documentation is compatible with Google Docs, supporting imports from Word format and exports to Google Docs for streamlined workflows.

## üóÑÔ∏è Data Platforms

Connect Vectice with leading data storage platforms to keep your data secure and accessible, enabling seamless data handling and compliance.
