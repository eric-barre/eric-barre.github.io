# Collaborate with your team

Vectice makes it easy to work together seamlessly. With comments, reviews, and feedback requests, you can connect with your team, share insights, and keep discussions focused right within the app.

## Add comments

We offer a standard commenting feature that lets team members share ideas and feedback directly in documents. Add notes or questions without leaving the page, making collaboration easy and keeping discussions focused.

## **Reviewing Comments**

Reviewing comments involves checking the comment section of the document, responding to feedback, and actioning suggestions where appropriate. This process helps to ensure that all team inputs are considered and integrated into the final work.

## Request reviews and feedback

Vectice simplifies collaboration through easy-to-use review and comments features, enhancing project quality and team communication. Reviews offer several benefits:

* Understand phase progress and data science efforts.
* Share phase results with stakeholders.
* Gather feedback from stakeholders and subject-matter experts.&#x20;

To request reviews, a phase must have an owner. Phase Owners can ask any workspace member for reviews.
{% endhint %}

To initiate a review, **select the Reviews tab** within your phase and select **Request a review**.&#x20;

When a review is requested, you'll get a Vectice notification with the requester's name and the phase that needs review. Click the notification to go to the review page. You can leave comments for feedback or questions and use the **Submit Review** button to provide feedback and approve or reject the phase progress.
