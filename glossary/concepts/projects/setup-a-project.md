# Setup a project

## Create a Project

Choose a workspace for your project and select one of four options:

1.  **Standard project with CRISP-DM template**

    A structured project template based on the CRISP-DM methodology, offering a proven framework with predefined phases for data-driven projects.
2.  **Empty project**&#x20;

    Start with a blank canvas, allowing total customization and flexibility to plan and structure your project.
3.  **Quickstart project**

    Create a Quickstart project to discover Vectice in a few easy steps.
4.  **Sample tutorial project**

    Create a tutorial project to learn about Vectice's features, functionalities, and workflows through practical experience.

Pick the option that best suits your project needs.&#x20;


Once you create a project, you will automatically become the **Project owner**. You can reassign the project ownership to any Workspace member within the project settings.


## Create a phase

Phases help guide projects one objective at a time. To learn more, view the [Phase](../phases.md) guide.

* If you created an **Empty project** -> select **Create phase**.&#x20;
* If you selected a project that has predefined phases, you can add a new phase by selecting **Create phase** or you can edit the names of the preexisting phase by selecting **Edit phase**.&#x20;
