# Document phase outcomes

Documenting phase outcomes is about summarizing what you've achieved and what improvements may come after completing each phase. It's crucial for understanding each project phase and presenting this info to stakeholders and decision-makers.

How you explain and present results can impact your company's decisions, so be clear and thorough to validate your conclusions.
{% endhint %}

Here are some suggestions to consider while summarizing the phase outcome:

* Check if the model meets the business success criteria.
* Review and document the work done in each iteration.
* Decide if there's a need for future improvements, iterations, or new projects based on the phase.

## Use Widgets to Highlight Key Asset Elements

Widgets allow you to display specific elements from your logged assets, such as lineage, metrics (for models), properties, or attachments. By default, all dataset or model version artifacts are included, but you can customize the widget to focus on what's most relevant as your project evolves.

When adding a dataset or model to your phase documentation, select "Customize widget" to tailor the displayed artifacts to your needs. Note that you must choose a specific version of the asset to customize its widget.
