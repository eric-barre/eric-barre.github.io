# Workspaces

## What are workspaces in Vectice?

Workspaces help **organize projects and members in an organization**, simplifying collaboration and permission management.

{% hint style="info" %}
Your organization can have multiple workspaces, each with its own projects, phases, and assets.

## Workspace Features

## Things to keep in mind

* Shared organization workspaces are public and accessible to all organization members.
* Each user will have access to a personal workspace. You can use the personal workspace to store personal projects and explore workspace capabilities.
* Your Workspace role determines the [permissions](../../admin-guides/user-management/user-roles-and-permissions.md#workspace-roles) you have within a workspace.

## Workspace Best Practices

* Although Admins can enable all users to create workspaces, this should be disabled for production environments to keep Vectice organized and monitor user permissions.
* Create a workspace for teams to group projects. For example, a data engineering team can group their data science pipeline-building projects in one workspace.
* Use comprehensive naming conventions for your workspaces. For example, for team-based workspaces, name the workspaces with the team's name.\*\*
* Provide a clear description and objective for each Workspace description.\*\*

\*\* This applies to Admins and Workspace Managers. For more information on role permission, view our [Role Permission Matrix](../../admin-guides/user-management/user-roles-and-permissions.md).
