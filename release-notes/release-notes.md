## Release 25.1 - Q1 2025

**Release Date:** April 7th, 2025

### Release summary

This release introduces a suite of powerful new features designed to enhance documentation quality, streamline onboarding, and improve visibility into data lineage. Highlights include the introduction of Next-Gen Autolog, allowing to leverage your metadata and code with Ask AI.

### New features

#### 1. **Next-Gen Autolog**

The Next-Gen Autolog feature significantly enhances the documentation process by combining metadata and code analysis. Powered by **Ask AI**, it automatically organizes logged asset metadata into meaningful sections, analyzes dataset transformations, and generates contextual, insightful commentary. This provides users with richer, more accurate, and context-aware documentation.\
