# Manage report templates

### Overview

Vectice provides a library of standard model documentation templates to help streamline compliance and leverage the metadata within Vectice. Powered with [Macros](../create-model-documentation-and-reports/streamline-documentation-with-macros.md) and [Ask AI](../introduction/vectice-overview/askai.md), these templates are maintained continuously by Vectice to ensure quick and efficient documentation to meet external regulations or internal standard requirements with minimal effort.

### How to use report templates

Vectice templates are ready to use for report generation. There are also various ways you can reuse them and create your own report templates in Vectice.

#### 1. Re-use and customize a Vectice template

We recommend to start from a provided template for standard model documentation. These templates come with built-in Macros and Ask AI prompts that automate report generation, reducing manual effort, taking advantages of Vectice built-in functionalities and ensuring compliant documentation. You can then modify this template to meet your own needs and fully automate the documentation process for your specific modeling use case.

**Steps to customize a Vectice template:**

* Browse the available templates in the Vectice library from your Avatar profile
* Select a template that fits your documentation needs and duplicate the template
* Customize the template as needed by applying styles, adding sections, Macros or Ask AI prompts
* Change the access level to Organization-shared if you want to make it available to all your colleagues, or keep it as Personal if you want to keep it for your personal use&#x20;

#### 2. Upload your own template

If you already have a documentation template, you can upload it to Vectice. We support Word documents (.docx) and will preserve the formatting and style while enhancing the template with automation suggestions.

**Steps to upload a template:**

* Upload your Word document to Vectice
* Vectice Support will process and analyze the template
* Suggested Macros and Ask AI prompts will be provided based on the documentâ€™s metadata
* The template will be made available in the library for your review
* Make any necessary adjustments to fit your needs
* Change the access level to Organization-shared if you want to make it available to all your colleagues, or keep it as Personal if you want to keep it for your personal use&#x20;

#### 3. Create a template from scratch

You can also build a report template from the ground up within Vectice. This approach takes the most effort and we recommend to contact our Support team if you need help with the process.

Start with a blank document and use the Vectice editor to structure and automate your documentation. Alternatively, you can copy-paste from your own Word template and customize further in Vectice with Macros and AskAi prompts.

**Steps to create a new template:**

* Open the report template creation tool in Vectice.
* Define the document structure and content, or copy-paste from your own Word template
* Utilize Macros and Ask AI prompts to automate data-driven sections.
* Change the access level to Organization-shared if you want to make it available to all your colleagues, or keep it as Personal if you want to keep it for your personal use&#x20;
