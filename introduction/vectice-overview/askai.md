# AskAI

**AskAI** helps you leverage the power of LLMs to document your AI/ML projects quickly. Teams can either use the Vectice library of customizable prompts designed for data science project documentation or create their own to generate entire documentation sections.&#x20;

By integrating directly with Vectice‚Äôs metadata, AskAI provides tailored insights and context-rich outputs, delivering more value than standalone tools like **ChatGPT**.

## Macros with AskAI

AskAI enhances macros by integrating GenAI capabilities into your reporting process. Pre-written prompts automatically generate important information using Vectice's internal metadata, enabling tailored, context-specific content creation directly in your reports.

This feature ensures that your documentation is not only accurate and insightful but also streamlined and easy to collaborate on. By embedding prompts into macros, teams can:

* **Automate text generation** with metadata-driven insights.
* **Maintain consistency** in reporting by standardizing prompts across workflows.
* **Save time and boost collaboration** with easy-to-access, pre-written prompts.
