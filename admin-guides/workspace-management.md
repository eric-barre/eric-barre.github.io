# Workspace management

To manage a workspace, you must have an **Admin** or a **Workspace Manager** role. Your Workspace role is displayed in the workspace members area within your settings.

{% hint style="info" %}
Although Admins can manage a workspace, they can not manage workspace members unless assigned the Workspace Manager role.
{% endhint %}

## Add workspace members

To add a member to your workspace, go to **Workspace Settings > Members** and enter their email address. Click '**Add Members**' to finish.

You can then begin typing the **email address** of the member you want to add to the workspace. Select the member(s) and click **Add Members**.

### Things to keep in mind:

* All workspaces **must** have at least one Workspace Manager.
* Workspace Managers can **remove** workspace members.
* Workspace Members can **view**, **create** and **update** projects and assets inside this workspace.
* All workspace members have permission to **add** members to a workspace.

## Workspace settings

{% hint style="info" %}
**Only** Workspace Managers and Admins have permission to update workspace settings.
{% endhint %}

To view or update workspace settings, select the **Workspace Settings** tab within your workspace. There you can manage your workspace settings.
