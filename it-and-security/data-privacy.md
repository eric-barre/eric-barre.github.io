# Data privacy

### Overview

To help you maintain control over your data, we provide options to limit the data captured by our Autolog API. Below are the key settings available to enhance privacy within your workflow.

#### 1. Disable notebook logging

By default, Autolog captures information from your notebook environment. To enhance privacy, you can disable this feature, ensuring that no data from your notebook is stored in Vectice.

#### 2. Disable dataset statistics

Autolog collects aggregated statistics related to datasets for performance insights. If you prefer to keep this information private, you can disable dataset statistics capture, preventing Autolog from storing dataset-related metadata.

#### 3. Disable model pickle capture

To protect your models, you can prevent Autolog from capturing and storing model pickle files. This ensures that your model artifacts remain within your controlled environment and are not automatically logged.

### How to Configure These Settings

To disable any of the above features, navigate to your organization settings and update your privacy preferences. By implementing these privacy controls, you can ensure that your sensitive data remains secure and in your control.
